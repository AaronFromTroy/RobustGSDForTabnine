## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 4-phase roadmap structure | 2026-01-18 | Quick depth with linear dependencies: Foundation → Infrastructure → Orchestration → Advanced |
| Sequential execution model | 2026-01-18 | Tabnine constraint: cannot spawn sub-agents, must adapt parallel patterns |
| Modular guideline loading | 2026-01-18 | Context window constraint: load only needed workflow file per phase |
| File-based state management | 2026-01-18 | STATE.md is human-readable, Git-friendly, manually editable if needed |
| AGENTS.md structure for guidelines | 2026-01-18 | Industry standard (60k+ projects), six core sections provide complete agent context |
| JavaScript template literals | 2026-01-18 | Built into Node.js, no external dependencies, simple ${var} syntax sufficient for templates |
| JSON Schema for config validation | 2026-01-18 | VS Code integration, standard validation, clear error messages |
| Affirmative phrasing in guidelines | 2026-01-18 | Agents reason better about positive actions than constraints, reduces misinterpretation |
| ESM modules for all scripts | 2026-01-18 | Modern JavaScript, better import/export clarity, Node 24 LTS first-class support |
| write-file-atomic for STATE.md | 2026-01-18 | Prevents corruption on interruption; native fs.writeFile() is NOT atomic |
| ajv for JSON Schema validation | 2026-01-18 | 50% faster than alternatives (joi, zod), 50M+ weekly downloads |
| .gitignore for node_modules | 2026-01-18 | Standard Node.js practice, prevents repository bloat from dependencies |
| spawn() instead of exec() | 2026-01-18 | Prevents shell injection, streams output vs buffering, safer with user input |
| Async file operations only | 2026-01-18 | No *Sync methods to avoid blocking Node.js event loop |
| Regex replacement for STATE.md | 2026-01-18 | Preserves manual edits outside tracked fields, selective field updates |
| Validation-before-write pattern | 2026-01-18 | Prevents invalid state from corrupting STATE.md, fails early with clear errors |
| STATUS_VALUES constants | 2026-01-18 | Type safety for state transitions, prevents typos in status field |
| Function constructor for templates | 2026-01-18 | Safe with controlled templates, native ${var} syntax, no external library needed |
| Integration test suite pattern | 2026-01-18 | Test each module independently + integration tests, accumulate failures, comprehensive reporting |
| Exact trigger matching only | 2026-01-19 | No fuzzy matching - prevents false positives during normal conversation |
| Visual confirmation for triggers | 2026-01-19 | Box format with 🔵 icon makes workflow activation unmistakable and requires explicit approval |
| Workflow conflict detection | 2026-01-19 | Check STATE.md before starting new workflow or continuing - prevents dual workflows |
| Configuration-driven triggers | 2026-01-19 | Load trigger phrases from .gsd-config.json - allows customization without code changes |
| Two-layer validation | 2026-01-19 | JSON Schema for metadata + regex for structure - comprehensive artifact validation |
| Error accumulation | 2026-01-19 | Collect all validation errors before throwing - user sees all issues at once |
| Remediation in error messages | 2026-01-19 | Include line numbers and fix commands - actionable guidance for users |
| ARTIFACT_SCHEMAS constant | 2026-01-19 | Centralized validation rules - extensible pattern for new artifact types |
| Brief checkpoint summaries | 2026-01-19 | Current position + next action only (not full history) - avoids overwhelming user on resume |
| Sequential workflow orchestration | 2026-01-19 | Returns guideline for Tabnine (no sub-agent spawning) - respects Tabnine constraint |
| Block invalid phase transitions | 2026-01-19 | Enforced validation prevents jumps (e.g., Phase 2 → 5) - ensures sequential execution |
| Recovery options for corruption | 2026-01-19 | Provide options to user (no auto-recovery) - prevents data loss from incorrect restoration |
| Confidence-based research findings | 2026-01-19 | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence levels for research transparency and source verification |
| Approval gate STATE.md logging | 2026-01-19 | Log decisions to Key Decisions table (not separate file) - Git-tracked audit trail |
| No CLI prompt libraries | 2026-01-19 | Tabnine handles approval UI natively - scripts prepare context and log decisions |
| Mock data for WebSearch integration | 2026-01-18 | Use generateMockSearchResults() until WebSearch available in Tabnine - enables development |
| Manual findings take precedence | 2026-01-18 | During merge, manual findings override automated for same URL - user input more trustworthy |
| HTTPS required for sources | 2026-01-18 | extractFindings() filters HTTP sources - security best practice |
| Forums excluded from findings | 2026-01-18 | Filter forum., reddit.com, discord. URLs - low signal-to-noise ratio |
| Type-specific query generation | 2026-01-18 | Different search queries for STACK/FEATURES/ARCHITECTURE/PITFALLS - better research quality |
| Phase 5 added to roadmap | 2026-01-20 | Polish and Distribution Readiness - prepare library for production use and public distribution after core functionality complete |
| Phases 6-8 added for robustness | 2026-01-20 | Discussion & Context System, Enhanced Research Infrastructure, Verification & Quality System - make Tabnine GSD more thorough without being as heavy as Claude Code GSD |
| Conventional Commits for versioning | 2026-01-21 | Enables automated versioning in CONTRIBUTING.md - feat → minor, fix → patch, BREAKING CHANGE → major |
| Package exports with subpaths | 2026-01-21 | Main entry (.) and subpath exports enable two import patterns for flexibility - common use vs specific modules |
| prepublishOnly safety gate | 2026-01-21 | Runs tests automatically before npm publish - prevents publishing broken code |
| MIT License for distribution | 2026-01-21 | Standard permissive open source license enables npm publishing and community contributions |
| Whitelist distribution control | 2026-01-21 | package.json files field as primary control (safer than .npmignore blacklist alone) |
| .npmignore as safety net | 2026-01-21 | Additional exclusions for dev files (.planning/, tests, CI) alongside files whitelist |
