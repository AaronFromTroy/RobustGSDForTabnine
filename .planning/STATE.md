## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 4-phase roadmap structure | 2026-01-18 | Quick depth with linear dependencies: Foundation → Infrastructure → Orchestration → Advanced |
| Sequential execution model | 2026-01-18 | Tabnine constraint: cannot spawn sub-agents, must adapt parallel patterns |
| Modular guideline loading | 2026-01-18 | Context window constraint: load only needed workflow file per phase |
| File-based state management | 2026-01-18 | STATE.md is human-readable, Git-friendly, manually editable if needed |

### Active TODOs

- [ ] Plan Phase 1: Foundation & Templates
- [ ] Create guideline files with unambiguous instructions
- [ ] Create all artifact templates with version metadata
- [ ] Write installation guide (README.md)

### Known Blockers

None

### Recent Changes

**2026-01-18:**
- Roadmap created with 4 phases
- All 55 v1 requirements mapped to phases
- Success criteria derived (24 total across all phases)
- STATE.md initialized

## Session Continuity

**Last Action:** Roadmap creation completed
**Next Action:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create execution plan for Foundation & Templates
**Context Needed:** PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md (all exist)

**Resume Instructions:**
If starting fresh session:
1. Read this STATE.md to understand current position
2. Read ROADMAP.md to see phase structure
3. Proceed with "Next Action" above
