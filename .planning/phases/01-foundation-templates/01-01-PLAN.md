<objective>
Create workflow guideline files that Tabnine agent uses to execute GSD workflows.

**Purpose:** Enable Tabnine to execute new-project, plan-phase, execute-phase, and verify-work workflows with unambiguous step-by-step instructions.

**Output:** Four guideline markdown files with YAML frontmatter, structured sections (Commands, Testing, Project Structure, Code Style, Git Workflow, Boundaries), and explicit success criteria.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create directory structure and new-project guideline</name>
  <files>gsd/guidelines/new-project.md</files>
  <action>
Create `gsd/guidelines/` directory.

Create `new-project.md` with:
- YAML frontmatter: version (1.0.0), type (guideline), workflow (new-project), last_updated, schema (gsd-guideline-v1)
- Six structured sections following AGENTS.md pattern:
  1. **Commands:** Exact Node.js script invocations with backticks
  2. **Testing:** How to validate workflow completion
  3. **Project Structure:** Expected file layout after workflow
  4. **Code Style:** N/A for this workflow (templates are markdown)
  5. **Git Workflow:** Commit messages and patterns
  6. **Boundaries:** What agent should do, ask first, never do
- Workflow steps (numbered, sequential):
  1. Create `.planning/` directory
  2. Generate PROJECT.md from template
  3. Generate REQUIREMENTS.md from template
  4. Update STATE.md with initial position
  5. Git commit with conventional format
- Success criteria (explicit, enumerated):
  1. `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists with all required sections
  2. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` exists
  3. `.planning/STATE.md` shows status: initialized
- Use affirmative language ("Do X" not "Don't do Y")
- Show exact commands: `node gsd/scripts/template-renderer.js --template=PROJECT --output=.planning/PROJECT.md`
- Reference RESEARCH.md anti-patterns to avoid (vague personas, negative phrasing, missing examples)
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at `gsd/guidelines/new-project.md`, contains YAML frontmatter with version field, has all six AGENTS.md sections, uses backticks for commands, includes numbered success criteria.
  </verify>
  <done>new-project.md guideline is complete and follows AGENTS.md structure with unambiguous instructions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create plan-phase and execute-phase guidelines</name>
  <files>gsd/guidelines/plan-phase.md, gsd/guidelines/execute-phase.md</files>
  <action>
Create `plan-phase.md` with:
- YAML frontmatter (version 1.0.0, type: guideline, workflow: plan-phase)
- Six structured sections (Commands, Testing, Project Structure, Code Style, Git Workflow, Boundaries)
- Workflow steps:
  1. Read ROADMAP.md to identify next phase
  2. Load CONTEXT.md or RESEARCH.md if exists for phase
  3. Break phase into 2-3 tasks per plan
  4. Create PLAN.md file(s) in `.planning/phases/XX-name/` directory
  5. Update STATE.md to reflect planning complete
  6. Git commit
- Success criteria:
  1. At least one PLAN.md exists for phase
  2. Each PLAN.md has required sections (objective, tasks, verification)
  3. STATE.md updated
- Explicit command examples with backticks

Create `execute-phase.md` with:
- YAML frontmatter (version 1.0.0, type: guideline, workflow: execute-phase)
- Six structured sections
- Workflow steps:
  1. Read PLAN.md for current phase
  2. Execute each task sequentially
  3. Validate task completion against <verify> criteria
  4. Create SUMMARY.md after all tasks complete
  5. Update STATE.md to mark phase complete
  6. Git commit
- Success criteria:
  1. All tasks in PLAN.md completed
  2. SUMMARY.md exists with outcomes
  3. STATE.md shows phase: completed
- Handle checkpoint tasks (pause for user input)
- Show exact script invocations

Both files use affirmative phrasing, unique conditions, concrete examples.
  </action>
  <verify>
Both files exist, contain YAML frontmatter with version, have six AGENTS.md sections, include numbered workflow steps, show command examples in backticks.
  </verify>
  <done>plan-phase.md and execute-phase.md guidelines follow AGENTS.md structure with clear sequential workflows</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create verify-work guideline with validation patterns</name>
  <files>gsd/guidelines/verify-work.md</files>
  <action>
Create `verify-work.md` with:
- YAML frontmatter (version 1.0.0, type: guideline, workflow: verify-work)
- Six structured sections (Commands, Testing, Project Structure, Code Style, Git Workflow, Boundaries)
- Workflow steps:
  1. Load SUMMARY.md for completed phase
  2. Validate artifact structure (required sections exist)
  3. Check requirements coverage (all mapped to phases)
  4. Verify success criteria met (from ROADMAP.md)
  5. Update STATE.md with verification status
  6. Create VERIFICATION.md if issues found
- Success criteria:
  1. All required artifacts exist and have correct structure
  2. 100% requirement coverage in roadmap
  3. All phase success criteria validated
  4. STATE.md shows verification: passed or issues documented in VERIFICATION.md
- Validation examples:
  - JSON Schema validation for .gsd-config.json: `node gsd/scripts/validator.js --schema=config --file=.gsd-config.json`
  - Artifact section checks: verify PROJECT.md has "What This Is", "Core Value", "Requirements" sections
  - Requirements traceability: every requirement in REQUIREMENTS.md maps to a phase in ROADMAP.md
- Explicit error messages and remediation guidance
- Use affirmative phrasing

File should be shorter (~60-80 lines) than workflow guidelines since verification is more focused.
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at `gsd/guidelines/verify-work.md`, contains YAML frontmatter, has six sections, includes validation command examples, shows explicit success criteria.
  </verify>
  <done>verify-work.md guideline provides clear validation workflow with explicit checks</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All four guideline files exist in `gsd/guidelines/` directory. Each file:
- Contains YAML frontmatter with version: "1.0.0"
- Has six AGENTS.md sections (Commands, Testing, Project Structure, Code Style, Git Workflow, Boundaries)
- Uses affirmative phrasing (not negative instructions)
- Shows exact command syntax in backticks
- Includes explicit, enumerated success criteria
- Avoids anti-patterns from RESEARCH.md (vague personas, ambiguous conditions)

Read each guideline file and verify structure matches AGENTS.md pattern.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
**Measurable completion:**
1. `gsd/guidelines/` directory exists with 4 markdown files
2. Each file has valid YAML frontmatter (parseable by gray-matter)
3. All files use backticks for command examples
4. No negative phrasing ("don't", "never" in instructions, only in Boundaries section)
5. Each guideline has numbered success criteria section
6. Files are human-readable and can be manually edited
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-templates/01-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- Guidelines created (4 files)
- Key patterns used (YAML frontmatter, six sections, affirmative language)
- Any deviations from RESEARCH.md patterns
- Next steps (templates and config)
</output>
