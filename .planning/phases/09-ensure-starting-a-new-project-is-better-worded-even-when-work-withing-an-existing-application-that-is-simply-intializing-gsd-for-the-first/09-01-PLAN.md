<objective>
Update error messages and internal logging in scripts to clarify that "starting GSD" means initializing GSD in the current project, not creating a brand new project.

Purpose: Eliminate confusion where users think they need an empty/new codebase to use GSD. The current "begin a new project" phrasing implies starting from scratch, when GSD actually works with existing applications.

Output: Updated error messages and workflow messages that explicitly state GSD initialization works for both new and existing projects.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update trigger-detector.js error messages</name>
  <files>gsd/scripts/trigger-detector.js</files>
  <action>
    Update 2 error messages in trigger-detector.js (lines 135 and 143) from:
    - "No active workflow found. Use 'start GSD' to begin a new project."

    To:
    - "No active workflow found. Use 'start GSD' to initialize GSD in this project.\nNote: This works for both new and existing codebases."

    This follows the research recommendation (09-RESEARCH.md "Clear Error Messages" pattern) to:
    1. Replace "begin a new project" with "initialize GSD in this project"
    2. Add explicit note that this works for existing codebases
    3. Use two-line format with \n for readability

    WHY explicit note: Research shows confusion comes from implicit assumptions. "Initialize" alone is better than "new project" but still leaves room for misinterpretation. The explicit note removes all ambiguity.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "initialize GSD in this project" gsd/scripts/trigger-detector.js
    grep -n "works for both new and existing" gsd/scripts/trigger-detector.js
    ```
    Both patterns should appear in the file.
  </verify>
  <done>
    trigger-detector.js contains updated error messages with "initialize GSD in this project" and explicit note about existing codebases.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update resume-manager.js error messages</name>
  <files>gsd/scripts/resume-manager.js</files>
  <action>
    Update 2 error messages in resume-manager.js (lines 129 and 171) from:
    - "No active workflow found. Use 'start GSD' to begin a new project."

    To:
    - "No active workflow found. Use 'start GSD' to initialize GSD in this project.\nNote: This works for both new and existing codebases."

    Same pattern as trigger-detector.js for consistency across error messages.

    WHY consistency matters: Users may encounter errors from different scripts. Consistent messaging prevents confusion about whether different commands have different meanings.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "initialize GSD in this project" gsd/scripts/resume-manager.js
    grep -n "works for both new and existing" gsd/scripts/resume-manager.js
    ```
    Both patterns should appear twice in the file (2 error message locations).
  </verify>
  <done>
    resume-manager.js contains updated error messages matching trigger-detector.js messaging.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update workflow-orchestrator.js workflow message</name>
  <files>gsd/scripts/workflow-orchestrator.js</files>
  <action>
    Update workflow start message in workflow-orchestrator.js (line 128) from:
    - message: 'Workflow started. Begin with new-project workflow.'

    To:
    - message: 'Workflow started. Initializing GSD in this project (works for new or existing codebases).'

    This is a success message (not error), so wording is slightly different but maintains same clarity:
    1. "Initializing GSD in this project" instead of "begin with new-project workflow"
    2. Explicit parenthetical note about new/existing
    3. Present tense ("initializing") indicates action happening now

    WHY different from error messages: This is shown when workflow successfully starts, so tone is confirmatory rather than instructional. Parenthetical keeps focus on action while providing context.

    Also update the comment on line 108 from:
    - "// Load newProject guideline"

    To:
    - "// Load initialization guideline (new-project.md)"

    WHY update comment: Internal consistency. Comment should reflect that this is about initialization, not literally creating a new project. Reference to filename shows continuity.
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "Initializing GSD in this project" gsd/scripts/workflow-orchestrator.js
    grep -n "initialization guideline" gsd/scripts/workflow-orchestrator.js
    ```
    Both updated strings should appear in the file.
  </verify>
  <done>
    workflow-orchestrator.js contains updated workflow message and comment clarifying this is initialization for any project type.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Run integration tests to verify changes</name>
  <files>none (verification task)</files>
  <action>
    Run the integration test suite to ensure messaging changes don't break functionality:

    ```bash
    node gsd/scripts/integration-test.js
    ```

    This verifies:
    - All scripts still execute correctly
    - Error handling logic unchanged (only message strings modified)
    - Workflow detection and resume functionality intact
    - No regressions introduced by string changes

    WHY run tests after string changes: While changing error messages seems low-risk, integration tests verify the entire workflow chain still works. This catches issues like:
    - Syntax errors introduced in string literals
    - Accidental modification of adjacent code
    - Breaking changes to message format that other scripts depend on
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    node gsd/scripts/integration-test.js
    echo "Exit code: $?"
    ```
    Integration tests should pass with exit code 0. All test cases should complete successfully.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Integration tests pass, confirming that messaging updates don't break existing functionality.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Run all updated scripts and verify messaging clarity:

```bash
# Verify grep patterns match all changes
grep -r "initialize GSD in this project" gsd/scripts/
grep -r "works for both new and existing" gsd/scripts/

# Run integration tests to ensure no breakage
node gsd/scripts/integration-test.js

# Manual verification: trigger an error to see new message
# (Attempt resume without STATE.md to see error message)
mv .planning/STATE.md .planning/STATE.md.backup 2>/dev/null || true
node gsd/scripts/resume-manager.js 2>&1 | grep -A 1 "initialize"
mv .planning/STATE.md.backup .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

All scripts should:
- Use "initialize GSD in this project" instead of "begin a new project"
- Include explicit note about working with existing codebases
- Maintain same error handling logic (only messages changed)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. All 3 script files updated with new messaging
2. Error messages explicitly state "initialize GSD in this project"
3. Messages include note about working with existing codebases
4. Integration tests still pass (no logic changes, only strings)
5. Messaging is consistent across all 3 files
6. No references to "begin a new project" remain in these scripts
</success_criteria>
