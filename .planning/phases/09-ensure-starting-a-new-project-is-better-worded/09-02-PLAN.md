<objective>
Update user-facing documentation (README.md, QUICKSTART.md) and configuration schema descriptions to clarify that GSD initialization works for both new and existing projects.

Purpose: Documentation is the first thing users read. Current wording creates false impression that GSD is only for brand-new projects. Explicit clarification in docs prevents confusion before users even try the system.

Output: Updated documentation with prominent callouts, prerequisite clarifications, and explicit examples showing GSD being added to existing codebases.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update README.md with initialization clarity</name>
  <files>gsd/README.md</files>
  <action>
    Make 4 strategic updates to README.md following 09-RESEARCH.md "Documentation Header Pattern":

    1. Update "What This Is" section (line ~11) - add after first bullet list:
    ```markdown

    **Works for any project:** Add GSD to new projects OR existing applications. You're adding workflow infrastructure to your current directory, not creating a new project from scratch.
    ```

    2. Update "Installation" heading (line ~55) to:
    ```markdown
    ## Installation

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Git repository initialized (`git status` works)
    - Node.js 18+ installed
    - Project directory exists (can contain existing code)

    **Important:** This adds GSD to your *current* project. Works for both brand-new directories and existing applications with code, dependencies, and structure already in place.
    ```

    3. Update "Workflows" > "1. New Project" section title and description (line ~284):
    ```markdown
    ### 1. Initialize GSD (new-project.md)

    **Trigger:** "start GSD"

    **What it does:** Adds GSD workflow system to your current project (new or existing)
    ```

    4. Update trigger phrases table (line ~147) header row:
    ```markdown
    | Workflow | Triggers | Action |
    |----------|----------|--------|
    | Initialize GSD | "start GSD", "begin GSD", "initialize GSD" | Add GSD to current project (creates `.planning/` directory) |
    ```

    WHY these 4 locations:
    - "What This Is" = first impression, sets expectation immediately
    - "Installation" = prerequisites clarify you can have existing code
    - "Workflows" section = shows actual workflow is initialization, not project creation
    - Trigger table = quick reference users return to

    DO NOT change:
    - Guideline filename references (new-project.md stays as-is per research recommendation)
    - Code examples or command syntax
    - Directory structure diagrams
    - Version numbers or metadata
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "Works for any project" gsd/README.md
    grep -n "Project directory exists (can contain existing code)" gsd/README.md
    grep -n "Initialize GSD (new-project.md)" gsd/README.md
    grep -n "Add GSD to current project" gsd/README.md
    ```
    All 4 patterns should appear exactly once.
  </verify>
  <done>
    README.md contains 4 strategic updates clarifying GSD works for existing projects, with prominent callouts and prerequisite clarifications.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update QUICKSTART.md with initialization clarity</name>
  <files>gsd/QUICKSTART.md</files>
  <action>
    Update QUICKSTART.md with 2 strategic changes following 09-RESEARCH.md patterns:

    1. Update "Prerequisites" section (after heading, before list):
    ```markdown
    ## Prerequisites

    **Important:** GSD adds workflow infrastructure to your *current* project. This works for:
    - Brand new projects (just created the directory)
    - Existing applications (adding GSD for the first time)
    - Projects with existing code, dependencies, and structure

    Before you begin, ensure:
    ```

    2. Update "Step 5: Start Using GSD" section description (around line showing "start GSD" command):
    Replace the description of what "start GSD" does with:
    ```markdown
    **"start GSD"**

    This initializes GSD in your current project by:
    ```

    WHY 2 locations only:
    - QUICKSTART is intentionally brief (5-minute guide)
    - Prerequisites section prevents confusion upfront
    - "Start Using" clarifies what initialization means
    - More detail deferred to README.md

    DO NOT change:
    - Installation steps (copying files, symlinks)
    - Command examples
    - Verification steps
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "GSD adds workflow infrastructure to your \*current\* project" gsd/QUICKSTART.md
    grep -n "This initializes GSD in your current project by:" gsd/QUICKSTART.md
    ```
    Both patterns should appear exactly once.
  </verify>
  <done>
    QUICKSTART.md contains prominent prerequisite clarification and clear initialization language, maintaining its concise 5-minute format.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update config-schema.json descriptions</name>
  <files>gsd/config-schema.json</files>
  <action>
    Update the workflow descriptions in config-schema.json to use initialization terminology.

    Find the "workflows" section's "properties" > "newProject" > "description" field and update from:
    - "Guideline file for initializing GSD (first-time setup in any project)"

    To (if different from current - may already be correct):
    - "Guideline file for initializing GSD in current project (works for new or existing codebases, first-time GSD setup)"

    This is shown in VS Code when hovering over .gsd-config.json fields, so clarity matters.

    WHY update schema descriptions:
    - VS Code shows these descriptions as hints when editing .gsd-config.json
    - Users configuring triggers see this explanation
    - Reinforces "any codebase" message at configuration time

    DO NOT change:
    - Schema structure ($schema, type, properties)
    - Property names (newProject key stays as-is for backwards compatibility)
    - Other workflow descriptions unless they have similar issues
    - Validation rules
  </action>
  <verify>
    ```bash
    grep -n "works for new or existing codebases" gsd/config-schema.json
    node -e "const schema = require('./gsd/config-schema.json'); console.log(schema.properties.workflows.properties.newProject.description);"
    ```
    Description should contain clarifying language about working with any codebase.
  </verify>
  <done>
    config-schema.json contains updated description for newProject workflow that explicitly states it works for new or existing codebases.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Verify documentation updates are clear and consistent:

```bash
# Verify all key phrases appear
grep -r "new or existing" gsd/README.md gsd/QUICKSTART.md gsd/config-schema.json
grep -r "current project" gsd/README.md gsd/QUICKSTART.md

# Check no confusing "new project" phrasing remains (allow "new-project.md" filename)
grep -i "new project" gsd/README.md gsd/QUICKSTART.md | grep -v "new-project.md" | grep -v ".md)"

# Verify markdown syntax is valid
npx markdownlint gsd/README.md gsd/QUICKSTART.md

# Verify JSON schema is valid
node -e "require('./gsd/config-schema.json'); console.log('Schema valid');"
```

All documentation should:
- Explicitly mention "new or existing" projects
- Clarify GSD adds to current project
- Maintain consistent messaging across all files
- Not break existing links or code examples
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. README.md has 4 strategic updates with explicit "new or existing" language
2. QUICKSTART.md has prerequisite clarification and initialization wording
3. config-schema.json description updated with codebase clarification
4. All markdown files pass linting (no broken syntax)
5. JSON schema remains valid
6. Messaging is consistent across all 3 files
7. No confusing "new project" phrasing remains (except filename references)
</success_criteria>
