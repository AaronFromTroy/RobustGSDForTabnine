<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create collaboration guideline</name>
  <files>gsd/guidelines/COLLABORATION.md, gsd/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create gsd/guidelines/COLLABORATION.md documenting multi-user collaboration workflows, patterns, and best practices.

Research-based content from 12-RESEARCH.md (patterns section lines 64-488).

Document structure (6 sections minimum):

1. Overview
   - Purpose: Git-based distributed collaboration without central server
   - Key patterns: branch-per-developer, worktree isolation, three-way merge
   - Benefits: offline-capable, no single point of failure, automatic conflict detection

2. Getting Started (Quick Start)
   - Prerequisites: Git 2.33.0+ (for ort merge strategy)
   - Installation: Copy .pre-commit-config.yaml to project root, install pre-commit framework
   - First worktree: node gsd/scripts/setup-worktree.js yourname 5
   - Next steps: cd to worktree, work on phase, commit, push, create PR

3. Branch-Per-Developer Workflow
   - Pattern: Each developer works in their own branch checked out in separate worktree
   - Branch naming: {developer}/phase-{NN} (e.g., alice/phase-05)
   - Workspace isolation: Each worktree has independent .planning/STATE.md
   - Example commands:
     ```bash
     # Alice starts Phase 5
     node gsd/scripts/setup-worktree.js alice 5
     cd ../worktrees/alice-phase-5
     # Work, commit, push
     git push -u origin alice/phase-05
     ```

4. Conflict Detection and Resolution
   - Pre-merge check: node gsd/scripts/conflict-checker.js alice/phase-05 main
   - Interpreting results: hasConflicts true/false, conflictFiles array
   - Resolution strategies:
     * Merge with ours: git merge -X ours alice/phase-05
     * Merge with theirs: git merge -X theirs alice/phase-05
     * Manual resolution: edit files, git add, git commit
   - Phase artifact conflicts: detectPhaseArtifactConflicts warns about same-phase work

5. Merge Strategies
   - Three-way merge: Git's default ort strategy (automatic conflict detection)
   - Pull request workflow: Create PR, status checks pass, merge to main
   - Co-authored commits: Use Co-authored-by trailers for attribution
   - Conventional Commits: Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat(phase-05): add distribution metadata

     Co-authored-by: Alice Smith <alice@example.com>"
     ```

6. Best Practices and Anti-Patterns
   - DO: Use worktrees for workspace isolation
   - DO: Commit phase artifacts (PLAN.md, code changes)
   - DO: Run conflict-checker before pushing
   - DO: Use Conventional Commits format
   - DON'T: Commit STATE.md (it's gitignored, local working state)
   - DON'T: Force-push shared branches (use --force-with-lease on personal branches only)
   - DON'T: Work on same phase simultaneously (coordinate phase assignments)
   - DON'T: Edit files outside your worktree directory

Include research citations:
- Git worktree docs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree
- Conventional Commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
- pre-commit framework: https://pre-commit.com/

Update gsd/README.md:
- Add "Multi-User Collaboration" section after "Usage" section
- Briefly describe branch-per-developer workflow
- Link to COLLABORATION.md for full guide
- Mention setup-worktree.js and conflict-checker.js scripts

Why this structure: Provides progressive depth (quick start → detailed patterns → best practices). Based on research section "Architecture Patterns" which covers all essential collaboration concepts.

  <name>Task 2: Add integration tests for Phase 12</name>
  <files>gsd/scripts/integration-test.js</files>
  <action>
Create Test Suite 18 in gsd/scripts/integration-test.js validating Phase 12 collaboration infrastructure.

Follow existing test suite pattern from integration-test.js (Test Suites 1-17).

Test Suite 18: Multi-User Collaboration (8 tests minimum)

1. setup-worktree.js module exports
   - Test: import { setupWorktree, listWorktrees, cleanupWorktree } from './setup-worktree.js'
   - Verify: all 3 functions exist and are typeof function
   - Pass: setupWorktree, listWorktrees, cleanupWorktree all defined

2. conflict-checker.js module exports
   - Test: import { checkForConflicts, detectPhaseArtifactConflicts } from './conflict-checker.js'
   - Verify: both functions exist and are typeof function
   - Pass: checkForConflicts, detectPhaseArtifactConflicts both defined

3. .gitignore excludes STATE.md
   - Test: read .gitignore file, check for STATE.md pattern
   - Verify: file contains "STATE.md" string
   - Pass: .gitignore includes STATE.md exclusion

4. .pre-commit-config.yaml template exists
   - Test: check file exists at gsd/templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml
   - Verify: file is readable, contains "conventional-pre-commit"
   - Pass: template exists with Conventional Commits hook

5. COLLABORATION.md guideline exists
   - Test: check file exists at gsd/guidelines/COLLABORATION.md
   - Verify: file contains "branch-per-developer" and "Git worktree"
   - Pass: guideline exists with collaboration patterns

6. listWorktrees basic functionality
   - Test: call listWorktrees() (may return empty array in test environment)
   - Verify: returns array (even if empty)
   - Pass: function executes without error, returns array

7. detectPhaseArtifactConflicts parameter validation
   - Test: call detectPhaseArtifactConflicts(5) with valid phase number
   - Verify: returns object with modifiedFiles and potentialConflicts properties
   - Pass: function executes, returns expected structure

8. Package exports include collaboration modules
   - Test: check package.json exports field
   - Verify: includes "./setup-worktree" and "./conflict-checker"
   - Pass: both subpath exports defined

Test implementation notes:
- Use try-catch for all tests (accumulate failures, don't stop on first error)
- Import collaboration modules at top of test suite
- Use fs.existsSync for file existence checks
- Use fs.readFileSync for content validation
- Don't create actual worktrees (test environment limitation)
- Mark as warnings if Git commands fail (may not be in Git repo during test)

Update test suite header:
- Change "Test Suites 1-17 (Phases 1-11)" to "Test Suites 1-18 (Phases 1-12)"
- Increment total test count by 8
- Add Phase 12 to suite list

Why 8 tests: Covers all new modules (2), configuration files (3), documentation (1), integration checks (2). Follows existing test suite pattern of 6-9 tests per suite.
